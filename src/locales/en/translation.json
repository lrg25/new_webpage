        "text": "Under which conditions do individuals decide to support different cash transfer proposals for the reform of the welfare state? In particular, under what conditions would individuals support new policy alternatives like a universal and unconditional basic income? My PhD dissertation has sought to shed a light on these intriguing questions, by employing novel theoretical arguments and a refined empirical approach based on conjoint and other survey experiments to uncover the causal impact of design features on support for UBI.  Some of the outputs of this research have been accepted for publication in the Journal of European Public Policy and the Journal of European Social Policy."

Crucially, can scientific information lead to an increased individual attention to topics and update beliefs or support towards new policy alternatives? These exciting questions have oriented some of my previous research and continue to guide some of my current work. In a previous paper, I examined whether political elites are responsive to scientific information and found that ideas attract more attention than scientific information. I am currently working on whether this is also the case amongst the broader public, looking at the impact of scientific information on individual attention to policy alternatives, update of beliefs and support for different policy proposals."

        "text": "While formal gender equality is increasing, other forms of gender inequality persist and are remain even exacerbating, like sexual violence. This is not only a question of gender justice or human rights but also an important health issue. The invisibilization of sexual violence, public opinion tolerance to this form of violence and the public’s ability to identify it as such, are crucial to the development and persistence of sexual violence. In this sense, my research focuses in the exploration of public perceptions of such violence and identifying the most effective policy interventions to curb this phenomenon. In previous research initiatives, I worked with a multidisciplinary team of five women to explore the different forms of sexual violence, of which you can read more about here. I am currently working on an extension of this research, by using an experimental approach that will test which policy interventions may be most effective at reducing such violence (find out more ",
